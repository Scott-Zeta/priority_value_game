Activity Name (suggestion): “Priorities Sorting Challenge”

Purpose:

To help participants reflect on and identify their top 5 personal values or priorities for the coming 6–12 months.

⸻

How It Works:

1. Initial Setup:
   • There is a pool of 40 value words (like Integrity, Courage, Creativity, etc.).
   • The goal is for each participant to end up with their top 5 values.
2. Decision Rounds:
   • In each round, 3 randomly selected words are displayed to the participant.
   • The prompt is:
   “Which of these three is the least important to you right now?”
   • The participant selects the word they feel is least relevant to their priorities for the next 6–12 months.
3. Elimination Process:
   • The selected word is removed from the pool.
   • A new set of 3 words is presented, randomly drawn from the remaining options.
   • This continues until only 5 words are left – those are the participant’s top 5 priorities.
